# Note, this class is called a singleton and it's a concept hard to understand, 
# but in simpler terms for this project think of this sound manager like this:

# In programming, a singleton is piece of code that no matter where you use it in the program, 
# there's only ever one of it.
# So, a singleton is a way to make sure there's only one of something important, 
# just like our one unique sound manager that contains all the sounds in the game.
# This is important to help the game running smoothly and run in many computers
