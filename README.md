# Poll of Lies

This game involves players in activities designed to improve their media literacy skills.

From a simple, user-friendly menu that introduces the game's goal, the players move onto a screen displaying two distinct healthcare-related social media posts. One of these posts contains false, unsubstantiated, or misleading information, while the other is true and accurate. Consequently, the player must utilize the internet to search for information that helps determine which post is truthful.

The fake posts are generated using the online tool [Zeoob](https://zeoob.com/), **intended solely for educational purposes such as this**. Participants are encouraged to witness the simplicity of creating a deceptively authentic social media post. This experience is designed to foster critical thinking skills for future online endeavours.

Conceptually, this game strives to:
- Highlight the fallacy that everything encountered on the internet is accurate;
- Promote the development of critical thinking, principles of media literacy, and proficiency in internet research;
- Encourage the dissemination of accurate healthcare information.

**Workshop 3 of the Game-It-Yourself Toolbox** seeks to impart fundamental concepts of game development and object-oriented programming through guided exercises to reconstruct missing pieces and mechanics of the game. These exercises include:  

- Familiarization with Godot's interface, scenes and node-based system;
- Executing actions upon button clicks through signals;
- Managing transitions between scenes;
- Generate new **fake** healthcare-related social media posts and mport images into the game;
- Understand and manipulate different types of data (boolean, string, integer, float, Texture2D [native to Godot]) and data structures (array);
- Understand and use logic structures to control the flow of code execution (selection, i.e. if-else conditions);
- Update and display score;
- Add the participant's name to the game's credits;
- Design a custom sprite sheet, and create and add to the game an AnimatedSprite2D that animates the aforementioned sprite sheet;
- Export the game.
