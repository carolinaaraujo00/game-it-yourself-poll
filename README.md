# Poll of Lies

This game involves players in activities designed to improve their media literacy skills.

From a simple, user-friendly menu that states the game's main goal, the players move onto a screen displaying two distinct healthcare-related social media posts. One of these posts contains false, unsubstantiated, or misleading information, while the other is accurate. Consequently, the player must utilize the internet to search for information that helps determine which post is truthful.

The fake posts are generated using an existing online tool called [Zeoob](https://zeoob.com/), intended solely for educational purposes such as this. Through this, participants are encouraged to directly witness the simplicity of creating a deceptively authentic social media post. This experience is designed to foster critical thinking skills that will benefit them in their future online endeavours.
